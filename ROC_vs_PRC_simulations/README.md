# ROC vs PRC Simulations

The setup of these simulations is adapted from some of the simulations found in 
[The Precision-Recall Plot Is More Informative than the ROC Plot When Evaluating Binary Classifiers on Imbalanced Datasets](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/metrics?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0118432)
However, the code and any mistakes are our own.
