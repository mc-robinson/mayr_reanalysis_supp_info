# Important information regarding the reanalysis of data from Mayr et al. (2018) #

### Overview ###

This folder contains the code to prepocess and analyze the data for our analysis of the original article by Mayr and coworkers,
[Large-scale comparison of machine learning methods for drug target prediction on ChEMBL](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2018/sc/c8sc00148k#!divAbstract).

Additional information on their code and dataset creation may be found at http://ml.jku.at/research/lsc/index.html or on their GitHub page https://github.com/ml-jku/lsc .

Much of our work is heavily derved/reliant on their data and code. We have done our best to clearly demarcate which work is their original data/code, and which is our extensions thereof. Please see the README files in the subdirectories for further information.

**All mistakes in the programs included herein should, of course, be assumed to be our own fault.**

### Obtaining and preprocessing the data ###

Most of their their data can be downloaded at http://ml.jku.at/research/lsc/mydata.html 
However, for our analysis, we mainly used the data in the `dataPythonReduced` section. 
This data is optimized for those using Python and includes only the data that is directly 
necessary for running their simple feed-forward neural network algorithm. 
This also reduces the memory requirements.

We recommend directly downloading the zip file in the browser: https://ml.jku.at/research/lsc/chembl20/dataPythonReduced.zip
The file https://ml.jku.at/research/lsc/chembl20/dataPythonReduced/chembl20Deepchem.pckl will also need to be downoaded.

Once unzipped, this data is used to construct fingerprints for further analysis/testing of algorithms. Creating this data involves the running of two separate programs: `data_preprocessing/initial_processing.py` and `data_preprocessing/make_sparse_fps.py`. Please note that the first of these programs is essentially copied from a portion of a script from Mayr et al., as is specified in the comments.

The main output of interest from these programs is included in the `data_for_replication` folder one level outside the `data_preprocessing` directory. The whole process is summarized as follows:
1. Download and unzip https://ml.jku.at/research/lsc/chembl20/dataPythonReduced.zip , thus creating a `data_preprocessing/dataPythonReduced` folder inside the `data_preprocessing` directory
2. Download https://ml.jku.at/research/lsc/chembl20/dataPythonReduced/chembl20Deepchem.pckl and place the file inside the recently created `data_preprocessing/dataPythonReduced/` directory.
3. Run the Python script `data_preprocessing/intial_processing.py`
4. Run the Python script `data_preprocessing/make_sparse_fps.py` 

Keep in mind that the size of the data needed and generated by these steps is quite large, and often outside the GitHub storage limits. Therefore we provide the data here (INSERT LINK)

Statement of modifications:
- ** The data in `data_preprocessing/dataPythonReduced` is directly copied from Mayr et al: http://ml.jku.at/research/lsc/mydata.html **
- ** The data in `data_for_replication` is generated by us.
